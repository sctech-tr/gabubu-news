    <h1>Former TikTok moderators sue over emotional toll of "extremely disturbing" videos</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/GabubuAvailable/news/raw/main/img/00002/00.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Finally, after so much years of cringe, crime, drama, fights, swearing and many shits on tiktok, former TikTok moderators sue over emotional toll of these kind of videos.</p>
    <p>I'm gonna explain why TikTok is the worst place and why we need to move from it or just uninstall the app.</p>
    <h2>The kids</h2>
    <p>I don't have problems with kids but they stay on TikTok even they are 5 years old. TikTok minimum age is 13 on almost every country but sadly the kids doesn't respect that rule. Making a false claim your account would be banned permanently. So kids, if you read this, you better wait until you'll get 13 instead of being cringe on TikTok. Thank you.</p>
    <h2>Cringe, crime, drama, nudity and pornographic gestures</h2>
    <p>Yeah... maybe you realized when you readed the subtitle. On TikTok you can see livestream with girls acting like a pornigraphic star or videos with boys or girls almost naked or even fully naked. And remember that this app is 13+, not 18+ app. So please move to PornHub instead... Seriously... You're gonna brainwash kid heads and I think you don't need that...</p>
    <h2>Moderators</h2>
    <p>Speaking of moderating and disturbing videos, who moderate that community? Why there are so many cringe and disturbing videos? Oh wait... Lemme tell you. Nobody moderates the community... That's just a stupid bot that makes everything. From checking the videos until reporting to the user. I tried this experiment and it was awful. I started to post normal contents on TikTok (REMEMBER: NORMAL CONTENTS. NO PORNOGRAPHY, NO CRINGE, NO DISTURBING VIDEOS). Guess what? After a few days I've got banned for literally nothing... And these TikTokers with pornographic gestures with their big *ss and b**bs and they don't get banned... Like wtf. You TikTok gonna hire moderators for checking the videos, not using a shit retarded bot that bannes every normal user.<br></p>
    <h2>In conclusinon...</h2>
    <p>Don't use TikTok. Or if you never used don't install it... That's a shit community with all retarded cringe kids and girls with idk poses and almost naked... That was my opinion about TikTok. If you want, you can take this post as a refference. I was Gabubu and I hope you liked it. Cya o/</p>
