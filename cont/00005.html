    <h1>Good news and Bad news</h1>
    <p>Welcome! Today we're gonna talk about... uhm... 2 "newses" ig.</p>
    <h2>Good news</h2>
    <p>The good news is: THE NUS IS BACK WOOOOHOOOOO!!!!</p>
    <p>That means you can still use the Wii Shop Channel just like it was before being offline: </p>

    <p>After being offline for 4 month they didn't make something special like updating the server or idk what. That's basically the Wii Shop Channel after closing... But I hope someone would backup the entire server because that's really important for having a working and still functional Wii.</p>
    <h2>Bad news</h2>
    <p>The bad news is kinda shit but still working these days. Today (07.07.2022) I received a message from my friend telling me that he's on a Discord server even he didn't joined that server. I was like "wtf" and I thought someone accessed his Discord account using the token. I told him to do "Reset password" but nothing... Even he leaves the server, he would be added automatically after leaving...</p>
    <p>But that's the problem... The hacker didn't used the token to login. Password neither because he have 2FA enabled... The problem was the "Authorized apps", a bot called "MaRy" which it can "Access the username, avatar and the banner", "See on what servers you are" and the last one "Join on servers for you". The last permission meaning the "MaRy" bot can add a person to the server without knowing.</p>
    <p>Here's a screenshot of what the bot can do:</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/GabubuAvailable/news/raw/main/img/00005/01.png" alt="">
    <p>In conclusion, if someone tolds you to go to on "https://letoa.me/bot" DON'T DO THAT! DO NOT authorize the app with your Discord account! Be based and check before clicking on something. *or move to irc if you want freedom*
    <h2>Outro</h2>
    <p>Sorry for being offline for a whi-... Actually wait... I already said that like thousands of times. I'll try to just be online and make more posts if I can but, hey, when I start something, I make that for a few days, and then I get bored and idk what to do with my life...</p>
    <p>Anyway I hope you enjoyed while reading this news. Have a great day o/</p>
