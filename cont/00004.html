    <h1>Time to move from bloated softwares to less-bloated softwares</h1>
    <p>Welcome! Today we're gonna talk about bloated softwares and why you should move to less-bloated softwares. Are you ready? I think so. ;)</p>
    <h2>What "bloated" means?</h2>
    <p>"Bloated" means overlarge and excessively fat. Something that's way bigger than the original product. Bloated softwares meaning the same thing, a simple software full of random spywares, shits and so on.</p>
    <h2>Why should we move to less-bloated?</h2>
    <p>Using a bloated softwares would "eat" all your resources. A very good example is Google Chrome and Chromium based browsers. If you 2 tabs openned, it would fill your RAM memory and then starting lagging. Another example is the Microsoft UWP apps. I mean seriously, exists .exe files and they are less-bloated than the UWP shits. And now let's talk about the less-bloated alternatives (some of them of course).</p>
    <h2>Less-bloated alternatives</h2>
    <p>Okay so you learned something today but the question is "Yeah but... uhm... what softwares should I use then?". Lemme make a list for you.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For Google Chrome and Chromium based browsers: <a href:"https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>, <a href:"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> and <a href:"https://surf.suckless.org/">Surf</a></li>
