    <h1>The Wii Shop and DSi Shop are offline and nobody knows why</h1>
    <p>The Wii Shop and DSi Shop channels have been down for days, prompting speculation that Nintendo may have pulled the plug on both storefronts without warning. </p>
    <p>It has been impossible to buy new content on either store for a while now, but the fact that console owners are unable to retrieve products they've already purchased is far from ideal. Anybody attempting to access either storefront will be met with an error code, although there is speculation that Nintendo's main server remains online due to the fact third-party tools like NUSDownloader can reportedly still be used to download titles.</p>
    <h2>!!!UPDATE!!!</h2>
    <p>Nintendo sent a statement about that problem. They say that Wii Shop Channel and Nintendo DSi Shop are currectly undergoing maintenance and they would provide an update at a later day.</p>
    <p>I hope they would fix that and Open Shop Channel replacement would be done. We wouldn't know when they will finally close these shops</p>
